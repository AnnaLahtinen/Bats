        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Bats are the only true flying mammals in the world</li>
          <li>A tiny pipistrelle can eat up to 3,000 insects in a night!</li>
          <li>
            Without bats you wouldn't have for example dates, vanilla, bananas,
            breadfruit, guavas, avocados, mangoes, Tequila or chewing gum.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bats are more closely related to humans than they are to mice.
          </li>
          <li>
            The majority of the world's bats eat insects. In the tropics bats
            also eat foods like fruit, flowers, frogs, fish, blood, even other
            bats.
          </li>
          <li>Bats can eat up to 1,200 mosquitoes an hour!</li>
          <li>Pallid bats eat scorpions!</li>
          <li>
            Bat droppings, called guano, are one of the richest fertilizers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The world's largest bat is the “flying fox,” which lives on islands
            in the South Pacific. A full-grown adult can have a wingspan of
            167.6 cm and weigh up to 1.2 kg.
          </li>
          <li>
            The world's smallest bat is the Kitti's Hog-nosed bat, also called
            the bumblebee bat, which is found in Thailand. They are 29-33mm
            long, weight about 1.7-2.0g and have a wingspan of 13-14.5cm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Baby bats are called pups! Most bats have only one pup a year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bats have few natural predators — disease is one of the biggest
            threats.
          </li>
          <li>The longest-living bat is 41 years old.</li>
          <li>Like cats, bats clean themselves.</li>
          <li>Bats have bellybuttons!</li>
          <li>Ancient civilizations worshipped bat-like gods.</li>
          <li>Blood-sucking 'Vampire bats' are real.</li>
          <li>When in flight, bats hearts beat 1,000 times a minute!</li>
          <li>Bats are hugely important for people and the planet.</li>
          <li>
            Currently, the oldest known fossil bat is 50 million years old.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bats are NOT blind; their eyes are attuned to low-light conditions
            and some species can see color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most but not all species of bats are nocturnal (active at night).
          </li>
          <li>
            Some bats live solitary lives, getting together only to mate, but a
            majority of species gather together in colonies of hundreds to
            thousands of individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bats do not spend any energy hanging upside down by their feet.  In
            the relaxed position, the toes and claws on a bat's foot are curled
            closed and muscles have to be used to open them.
          </li>
          <li>
            The wings of a bat are formed by a thin membrane that runs along the
            length of their arm, is stretched between their long, thin fingers,
            attached to their hind legs, and often a tail.
          </li>
          <li>Bat Colonies Save Humans Billions in Pest Control.</li>
